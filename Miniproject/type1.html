            Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors and extending
            into the Atlantic Ocean, New York City comprises five boroughs, each
            of which is coextensive with a respective county of the state of New
            York. The five boroughs—Brooklyn (Kings County), Queens (Queens
            County), Manhattan (New York County), the Bronx (Bronx County), and
            Staten Island (Richmond County)—were created when local governments
            were consolidated into a single municipal entity in 1898. The city
            and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal
            immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are
            spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city
            in the world. New York City is home to more than 3.2 million
            residents born outside the United States, the largest foreign-born
            population of any city in the world as of 2016. As of 2022, the New
            York metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan
            product of over $2.1 trillion, ranking it first worldwide. If the
            New York metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would have the
            eighth-largest economy in the world. As of 2022, New York is home to
            the highest number of billionaires and millionaires of any city and,
            in 2017, was the wealthiest city in the world.
